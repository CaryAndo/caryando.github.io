So with this new blog set up, and school coming to and end soonish, I’m looking for a good summer project to really get motivated about and accomplish. Something that’s doable over the course of three months but still big enough to challenge me. I’ve been thinking about a few Android app ideas and a game I really want to make, but I haven’t landed on anything I love. I originally wanted to participate in Google Summer of Code, but I underestimated how intimidating the application process would be. Brainstorming with my friend is always good but I haven’t had time to really sit down and talk with him in a while. I should definitely do that.
