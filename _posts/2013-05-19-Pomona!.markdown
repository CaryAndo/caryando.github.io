So if I complete all my classes this semester, something that I’m working very hard to accomplish right now, then I’ll be attending CalPoly Pomona next fall. I’m really excited about it, as it’s the college I’ve wanted to go to for a very long time. I had a moment of indecision a few weeks ago when I found that I had the option to go to any of the schools I had applied to :/ and I nearly picked CSULB. After touring both schools though, I decided that the Pomona campus felt a lot more like my kind of place. It feels so much more focused and the students seem just a bit more “studious” :P Long Beach, while it seemed like a good fun school, felt a little more like a place to party. Even though the Pomona curriculum will be more demanding, especially in the math and physics courses, I think I’ll get more out of it and overall be better for challenging myself. But god I hope I do well with this current semester!
